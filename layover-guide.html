    <h1>✈️ RoadWarriorHQ Layover Survival Guide</h1>
    <p>Layovers don't have to be time-wasters. Whether you're on a quick domestic connection or stuck for hours on an international route, you can use that time to recharge, get work done, or even explore. Here's how to make the most of it.</p>

    <h2>1. Know How Much Time You Actually Have</h2>
    <p>Start by checking your arrival and next departure gate. Just because you have a 90-minute layover doesn't mean you have 90 free minutes. Factor in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Time to deplane (10–15 minutes)</li>
      <li>Terminal transfers (can be 5–30+ minutes)</li>
      <li>Boarding time for your next flight (typically 30 minutes before departure)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Quick Math:</strong> If your layover is 90 minutes and boarding starts 30 minutes before departure, you really have 60 minutes — and only 30–40 of those are flexible if gates are far apart.
    </div>

    <h2>2. Use Tech to Stay Ahead of Delays</h2>
    <p>Don’t wait for the airport screens to tell you your flight is late. Get real-time updates faster using these tools:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flighty</strong> (iOS): Best-in-class delay prediction and gate changes</li>
      <li><strong>TripIt Pro</strong>: Aggregates all your flight info and alerts you about changes</li>
      <li><strong>Airline Apps</strong>: Enable push notifications for live updates</li>
      <li><strong>Flightradar24</strong>: See where your inbound plane is in real time</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Set up alerts for BOTH your connecting and final flight. Sometimes rebooking is easier while you're still in the air.
    </div>

    <h2>3. Maximize Your Time: Rest, Recharge, or Focus</h2>
    <p>Once you know how much time you really have, choose your strategy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quick Reset:</strong> Use lounge showers or quiet zones if you only have 30–45 minutes</li>
      <li><strong>Focus Mode:</strong> Grab a quiet seat with power outlets and knock out 1–2 tasks</li>
      <li><strong>Recharge:</strong> Use noise-cancelling headphones to nap or decompress</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Bonus:</strong> If you have 3+ hours, research if the airport offers short excursions, art galleries, or even hotel day rooms.
    </div>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Layovers don't have to be a grind. With a little planning, the right tools, and the right mindset, you can turn them into a productive pause in your journey — or at least avoid the chaos.</p>
